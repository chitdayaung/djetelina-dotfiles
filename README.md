# My .files

Here are my personal dotfiles with all the configurations that I hold the most dear and I want to be able to set them up anywhere easily.

It will take a while for me to finish the `_INSTALL` script, because I don't remember all the prerequisites, but the goal is to just run install, switch to zsh and have everything ready. It might require sudo in the future, I honestly don't remember!
