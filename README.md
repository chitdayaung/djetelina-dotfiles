# My .files

Here are my personal dotfiles with all the configurations that I hold the most dear and I want to be able to set them up anywhere easily.

It will take a while for me to finish the `_INSTALL` script, because I don't remember all the prerequisites, but the goal is to just run install, switch to zsh and have everything ready. It might require sudo in the future, I honestly don't remember! 

## Shell

### zshrc

Main configuration for shell

### zsh_aliases

Aliases that wouldn't be too good if ran from bash (sourced from ssh etc.)

### bash_aliases

More general aliases

## Other stuff

### vimrc

I'll be honest I stole most of this, just to make vim a bit bearable
