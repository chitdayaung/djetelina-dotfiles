# My .files

Here are my personal dotfiles with all the configurations that I hold the most dear and I want to be able to set them up anywhere easily. Just run `./INSTALL`!

#### TODO

- Fonts

## Shell

### zshrc

Main configuration for shell

### zsh_aliases

Aliases that wouldn't be too good if ran from bash (sourced from ssh etc.)

### bash_aliases

More general aliases

## Other stuff

### vimrc

I'll be honest I stole most of this, just to make vim a bit bearable
